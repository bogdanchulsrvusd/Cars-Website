        <h1>Sports Cars</h1>

        <p>A sports car is a type of car that prioritizes performance and driving experience over utility or practicality. They are designed with aerodynamics, handling, acceleration, and top speed in mind. While traditionally sports cars were two-seaters, there are now a wide variety of seating arrangements available. Many car manufacturers produce sports cars today, with models ranging from affordable to extremely high-end. Whether you value the thrill of driving, want to turn heads on the road, or plan to take the car to the track, a sports car may be the right choice for you.</p>
